# Motorcycle-Helmet-Crash-Analysis
We collaborated in a team of two to perform this research work. The motorcycle helmet was designed using CREO Parametric and it's
crash test was performed using LS-DYNA as a solver and the HyperMesh as a preprocessor. The increase in the foam thickness played
a crucial role in the decrement of the peak acceleration on the headform. A reversed mass distributed helmet with light weight shell
and more weight Polyurethane foam was proposed.
