# Bachelors-Research-Motorcycle-Helmet-Crash-Analysis

- Managed team of two to perform this research work
- The motorcycle helmet was designed using CREO Parametric
- HyperMesh was used as a pre-processor
- Crash test was performed as per the norms of FMVSS 218 using LS-DYNA as a solver 
- The increase in the foam thickness played a crucial role in the decrement of the peak acceleration on the headform (reduced by 14 %)
- Pioneered 1150 gm safe, reversed mass distributed helmet with light weight fiberglass shell and Polyurethane
